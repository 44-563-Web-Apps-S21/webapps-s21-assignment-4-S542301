   <h4>All's Well That Ends WellHenry IV, part 1</h4>
   <h6>Helen heals the King of France, and the King grants her permission to marry Bertram, 
       the man she loves. Bertram rejects her and leaves a list of tasks that she must do to have him 
       acknowledge their marriage. She follows him to Italy, completes all the tasks, and Bertram 
       accepts her as his wife. </h6>
       In the French province of Roussillon, the widowed Countess bids farewell to her son Bertram. 
       Bertram is going to the court of the French King with his swaggering friend Paroles and the Lord 
       Lafeu. Bertram leaves oblivious to the attentions of Helen, the orphan daughter of the Countess's 
       celebrated physician. Helen has been brought up in his mother's household and has fallen in love 
       with Bertram.The Countess allows Helen to go to court and try her hand at curing the King's 
       illness. Where others have failed, she succeeds, and as a reward, the King asks her to choose a 
       husband from among his wards. (Who else would she choose but Bertram?) Bertram sees the alliance 
       as beneath him. After the marriage ceremony, he runs away and plans to join the wars in Italy 
       with Paroles.He writes to Helen that he will not acknowledge their marriage until she can prove 
       she wears his heirloom ring and carries his child. Helen returns home to Roussillon, 
       but she does not give up. Instead, she soon leaves and, disguised as a pilgrim, follows Bertram 
       to Florence. There, she befriends a widow and her daughter Diana. Meanwhile, Bertram has formed 
       an obsession with Diana during his time in Italy. The soldiers jokingly trick Paroles into 
       proving he is a coward, while Bertram makes intentions to sleep with Diana. Back at the French 
       court, Helen is presumed dead in Roussillon due to her absence. Bertram returns to France, 
       where his mother and Lafeu have arranged for Bertram to marry Lafeu's daughter. Bertram gives 
       Lafeu, as a betrothal token, a ring that he had been given on his midnight meeting with Helen 
       in Florence. The King and others recognise the ring to be one that the King had given to
       Helen on her marriage.
