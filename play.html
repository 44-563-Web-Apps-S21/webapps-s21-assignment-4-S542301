   <h4>All's Well That Ends WellHenry IV, part 1</h4>
   <h5>SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.</h5>
<p class="stage-direction">Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</p>

<h6 class="name king">KING</h6>
<p class="speech">The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
Have fought with equal fortune and continue
A braving war.</p>

<h6 class="name First">FIRST LORD</h6>
<p class="speech">So 'tis reported, sir.</p>

<h6 class="name king">KING</h6>
<p class="speech">Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
With caution that the Florentine will move us
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business and would seem
To have us make denial.</p>

<h6 class="name first">First Lord</h6>
<p class="speech">His love and wisdom,
Approved so to your majesty, may plead
For amplest credence.</p>

<h6 class="king">KING</h6>
<p class="speech">He hath arm'd our answer,
And Florence is denied before he comes:
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
To stand on either part.</p>

<h6 class="name second ">Second Lord</h6>
<p class="speech">It well may serve
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
For breathing and exploit.</p>

<h6 class="name king">KING</h6>
<p class="speech">What's he comes here?</p>

<p class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</p>

<h6 class="name first">First Lord</h6>
<p class="speech">It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
Young Bertram.</p>

<h6 class="name king">KING</h6>
<p class="speech">Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</p>
